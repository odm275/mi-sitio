Oscar Mejia is a Software Developer in Houston, Texas.

I am interested in building Software practically, efficiently, and painlessly. That includes [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [tRPC](https://trpc.io/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

I lead and take part in discussing projects from ideas to products with clients, work with designers to produce mock ups, and develop fullstack web applications.
