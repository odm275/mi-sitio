# The Challenge:

Candelaris and its businesses have a vital mission: To deliver the authentic Italian experience to the people. An efficient management of their inventory and orders
needs to occur in order for them to be able to deliver the Italian experience to the people.
Candelaris and its businesses needed a comprehensive technology program to improve their inventory management, employee trainning, communication between
managers and kitchens, and orders between the kitchen commisary and its locations. And as an expanding businesses, critical improvements were
identified to be able to accommodate growing pains.

## Planning the App

Planning the app: Database, Backend, and Front End.

### Database

When deciding a database I had the following considerations:

1.  SQL or NoSQL. Choosing SQL

    - Given that the App was going to be heavily relational in nature. The natural choice was SQL.
    - Unless there is a very specific need for a NoSQL database, a relational database will lead to less suffering.
    - Prisma db push allows me to skip migrations if I really want to. Thus, I can be nimble like in noSQL but keep retain the benefit from SQL databases bring.

2.  Choose a Cloud Provider (Heroku, Railway, Render, Planetscale). Choosing Railway

    - I considered planetscale(mysql) due to their superb version control database management features, however,
      given the scale of the project, I felt it was overkill. If the project had an unlimited budget, I would have gone with planetscale.

    - Railway was the easiests to set up and their payment costs were right. I spun up a Postgres staging and production instance in less than 5 minutes ðŸ˜³

Now that I had my database requirements set, I went on to design the Database schema:

The Database Fluid Charts

### Backend

For a long time GraphQ, but then trpc, grpahql seemed redundant. Next.js api routes because better developer experience, easier deployment.

#### Auth0

Auth is sometimes complicated, and I wanted an easy and robust solution. Wanted to Focus on building the App, rather than implementing authentication.

For Authentication I considered NextAuth.js, however for this application having a password and username is important, this authentication method
is not well supported in NextAuth.js, so I ended up going with Auth0.

### Frontend

Even thought the app is all client rendered. I went with next.js. React Query, I considered loading data in the server, but stuck the interactivity,
seamnless user flow optimistic queries produce, and simplier to manage.
Chackra UI, it is a internal tool, no need for slick design, but still need a cohesive and professional look.
React Hook Form for form management.
useReducer for handling orders Form.
