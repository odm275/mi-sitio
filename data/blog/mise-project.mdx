# The Challenge:

Candelaris and its businesses have a vital mission: To deliver the authentic Italian experience to the people. An efficient management of their inventory and orders
needs to occur in order for them to be able to deliver the Italian experience to the people.
Candelaris and its businesses needed a comprehensive technology program to improve their inventory management, employee trainning, communication between
managers and kitchens, and orders between the kitchen commisary and its locations. And as an expanding businesses, critical improvements were
identified to be able to accommodate growing pains.

## Planning the App

Planning the app: Database, Backend, and Front End.

### Database

Given that the App was going to be heavily relational in nature. The natural choice was SQL. I considered planetscale(mysql) due to their
superb version control database management features, however, given the scale of the project, I felt that a postgres instance on railway was the best option as
I wouldn't end up needed all the fancy database version control features. Hence, I went with a postgres instance on railway.

The Database Fluid Charts

### Backend

For a long time GraphQ, but then trpc, grpahql seemed redundant. Next.js api routes because better developer experience, easier deployment.

#### Auth0

Wanted to Focus on building the App, rather than implementing authentication.
Show the hooks in Auth0 maybe?

### Frontend

Even thought the app is all client rendered. I went with next.js. React Query, I considered loading data in the server, but stuck the interactivity,
seamnless user flow optimistic queries produce, and simplier to manage.
Chackra UI, it is a internal tool, no need for slick design, but still need a cohesive and professional look.
React Hook Form for form management.
useReducer for handling orders Form.
